## Architectural Overview and Design

### 1. Current Codebase Architecture (Conceptual)

Based on the file structure and provided snippets, the current architecture appears to be structured around a core `Hypergraph` data model, which stores `Concept`s and `Event`s.

*   **Core Components (`eventual/core/`)**: This seems to be the heart of the system, defining the fundamental data structures (`Concept`, `Event`, `Hypergraph`) and potentially core logic (`Sensor`, `TemporalBoundary`, `ConceptDetector`).
*   **Data Components (`eventual/data/`)**: Responsible for getting data into and possibly out of the system (`Extractor`, `Integrator`).
*   **Stream Components (`eventual/streams/`)**: Handle sequences or flows of data/events (`DeltaStream`, `InstanceStream`, `SensoryEventStream`). These likely represent different ways of viewing or processing changes or sequences over time.
*   **Utility Components (`eventual/utils/`)**: Provide helper functions and specific processing logic, such as `TextProcessor`, which interacts significantly with the `Hypergraph`.
*   **Pipeline (`eventual/pipeline.py`)**: Likely acts as the orchestrator, connecting the various components (Sensors, Processors, Streams, Hypergraph) to define a complete data processing workflow.

The flow seems to be generally: Data Source -> Sensor -> Extractor -> Processor (e.g., TextProcessor) -> Interaction with Hypergraph/Streams -> Integrator (potentially for output or storage). The `Pipeline` binds these together.

The snippet from `TextProcessor` specifically shows it directly accessing and iterating through the internal `concepts` dictionary of the `Hypergraph` to find existing concepts. It then adds new concepts and events directly to the hypergraph.

### 2. Evaluation of the Current Architecture

**Strengths:**

*   Clear separation into logical directories (`core`, `data`, `streams`, `utils`).
*   Identifiable core data structures (`Hypergraph`, `Concept`, `Event`).
*   The structure suggests a pipeline processing approach, which is suitable for data workflows.

**Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Tight Coupling (e.g., `TextProcessor` and `Hypergraph`):** The snippet clearly shows `TextProcessor` reaching into the `Hypergraph`'s internal structure (`hypergraph.concepts.values()`) to perform a concept lookup. This creates tight coupling. `TextProcessor` is dependent on the internal implementation details of `Hypergraph`. If the internal structure of `Hypergraph` changes (e.g., from a dict to a list or a different lookup mechanism), `TextProcessor` would break.
2.  **Inefficient Hypergraph Interaction:** Manually iterating through all concepts to find one by name (`O(N)` where N is the number of concepts) is inefficient, especially as the hypergraph grows. The `Hypergraph` class should provide optimized methods for common operations like lookup, addition, and retrieval.
3.  ** unclear Component Responsibilities:** While directories exist, the exact responsibilities and boundaries between components (e.g., what exactly does `Extractor` do vs. `Processor` vs. `Integrator`?) might need clearer definition and stricter enforcement through interfaces.
4.  **Potential for Scalability Issues:** Tight coupling and potentially inefficient data access patterns can hinder scalability as the volume of data or the size of the hypergraph increases.
5.  **Testability:** Tightly coupled components are harder to test in isolation because they have direct dependencies on concrete implementations of other components.

### 3. Proposed "Top Tier" Architecture

To address the weaknesses and achieve a more elegant, maintainable, and scalable architecture, I propose the following improvements:

**Core Principles:**

*   **Stronger Encapsulation:** Components should interact only through well-defined public interfaces, hiding internal implementation details.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Each component should have a single, clear responsibility.
*   **Efficient Data Access:** The `Hypergraph` should provide efficient methods for querying and updating data.
*   **Decoupling:** Components should be as independent as possible, potentially communicating via events or messages.
*   **Configurability:** The pipeline and components should be easily configurable.

**Architectural Components & Structure:**

1.  **Core (`eventual.core`)**: Remains the heart with core data structures (`Concept`, `Event`, `TemporalBoundary`).
    *   **Refactored `Hypergraph`**: This class becomes the central *repository* for concepts and events. It *must* provide efficient methods for:
        *   `add_concept(concept: Concept)`
        *   `get_concept_by_id(concept_id: str) -> Optional[Concept]` (O(1) lookup)
        *   `get_concept_by_name(name: str) -> Optional[Concept]` (Requires internal indexing, e.g., a `name -> id` map for O(1) average lookup)
        *   `add_event(event: Event)`
        *   `get_events_by_concept(concept_id: str) -> List[Event]`
        *   `update_concept_state(concept_id: str, state_change: float)`
    *   `ConceptDetector`, `Sensor`, `TemporalBoundary` remain, but their interaction with `Hypergraph` will use the new interface.
2.  **Processors (`eventual.processors`)**: (Renaming `utils` or creating a new top-level module)
    *   `TextProcessor` (and others): These components are responsible *only* for taking input data (e.g., text) and *outputting* extracted information (e.g., lists of concept names, relationships). They should *not* directly modify the `Hypergraph`.
    *   Their output should be a standardized data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries or data objects) that represents the extracted insights.
3.  **Ingestors (`eventual.ingestors`)**: (Renaming `data` or creating a new top-level module)
    *   `Extractor`s: Focus solely on reading and structuring raw data from various sources.
    *   `Integrator`s: Responsible for taking the structured output from Processors and *applying* it to the `Hypergraph` using its public update methods. This separates the logic of *what* to extract from *how* to update the central data store.
4.  **Streams (`eventual.streams`)**: Remain as views or filtered sequences of data/events, possibly subscribing to changes in the `Hypergraph` or events emitted during processing.
5.  **Pipeline (`eventual.pipeline`)**: The orchestrator.
    *   Configures and connects Ingestors, Processors, and Integrators.
    *   Manages the lifecycle of the `Hypergraph` instance.
    *   Coordinates the flow of data from source -> Extractor -> Processor -> Integrator -> Hypergraph.
6.  **Event Bus / Messaging (Optional but recommended for scale):** Introduce a simple in-memory (or pluggable) event bus.
    *   Processors publish events (e.g., `ConceptExtractedEvent`, `RelationshipFoundEvent`).
    *   Integrators subscribe to these events and update the `Hypergraph` accordingly.
    *   Streams could also subscribe to events or `Hypergraph` changes.
    *   This decouples components further, allowing them to operate more asynchronously.
