# Task Log: Implement Knowledge Retrieval

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-05-07
- **Time Started**: 00:00
- **Time Completed**: 18:50
- **Files Modified**:
    - `eventual/core/hypergraph.py`
    - `tests/test_hypergraph.py`

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement the Knowledge Retrieval functionality within the `Hypergraph` class.
- **Implementation**: Added the `retrieve_knowledge` method to the `Hypergraph` class. This method tokenizes and lemmatizes a query string, finds matching concepts in the hypergraph, and collects all events involving those concepts. Also added unit tests for this method.
- **Challenges**: Fixing syntax errors introduced during the modification of `eventual/core/hypergraph.py`.
- **Decisions**: Decided to implement a basic keyword matching approach for knowledge retrieval based on concept lemmas. Ensured that the `Hypergraph` class initializes the spaCy model for lemmatization.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23
- **Strengths**: The `retrieve_knowledge` method is implemented and tested. All tests for `test_hypergraph.py` are passing.
- **Areas for Improvement**: The current knowledge retrieval is basic. It could be improved by implementing more sophisticated techniques like vector similarity search or graph traversal algorithms.

## Next Steps**:
- Implement Situational Awareness Adapter.
- Commit the changes.
