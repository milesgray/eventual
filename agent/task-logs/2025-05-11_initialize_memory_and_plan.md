## Task Details
- **Goal**: Initialize the agent's memory bank by aligning core context files and documenting the initial refactoring plan.
- **Implementation**:
    - Read existing project files (setup.py, eventual/core/hypergraph.py, README.md) to understand the current project state.
    - Wrote content to agent/core/techContext.md based on dependencies.
    - Wrote content to agent/core/systemPatterns.md based on the core hypergraph architecture.
    - Wrote content to agent/core/projectbrief.md based on the project description.
    - Wrote content to agent/core/productContext.md based on features and target users.
    - Wrote the detailed refactoring roadmap (Phases 1-7) to agent/core/progress.md.
    - Wrote detailed plans for the first three tasks (P1_T1.1, P1_T1.2, P1_T1.3) to files in agent/plans/.
    - Created and updated the agent/memory-index.md file to list all core and plan files.
    - Updated agent/core/activeContext.md to reflect the current focus on starting Phase 1.
- **Challenges**: None during this initialization phase.
- **Decisions**:
    - Decided on a phased approach for refactoring (7 phases).
    - Broke down the initial phase (Strengthen Hypergraph) into three specific tasks with detailed plans.
    - Established the directory structure and naming convention for plans and task logs.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23 (Initialization successful, all required files created/updated, plans documented, context set).
- **Strengths**: Successfully aligned core memory files and documented a clear path forward with detailed plans.
- **Areas for Improvement**: None for this initialization task.

## Next Steps
- Git commit all changes made during the initialization phase.
- Begin execution of the first task in the refactoring roadmap (Phase 1, Task 1.1).
