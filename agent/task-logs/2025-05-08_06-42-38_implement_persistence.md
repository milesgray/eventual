# Task Log: Implement Persistence

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-05-08
- **Time Started**: 05:56
- **Time Completed**: 06:42
- **Files Modified**:
    - `eventual/core/concept.py`
    - `eventual/core/event.py`
    - `eventual/core/hypergraph.py`
    - `eventual/persistence/hypergraph_persistence.py`
    - `tests/test_hypergraph_persistence.py`

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement the persistence mechanism for the hypergraph.
- **Implementation**: Added `to_dict` and `from_dict` methods to `Concept`, `Event`, and `Hypergraph` classes for serialization and deserialization. Created a `HypergraphPersistence` class with `save_hypergraph` and `load_hypergraph` methods using JSON. Added unit tests for persistence, including creating a test directory for save files.
- **Challenges**: Resolving `SyntaxError` issues caused by unescaped backslashes in docstrings during test collection. Fixing `FileNotFoundError` by creating a dedicated directory for test save files.
- **Decisions**: Implemented JSON serialization for persistence. Handled circular dependencies between Concept and Event during serialization/deserialization by storing/loading event IDs in Concept and linking events to concepts in Hypergraph.from_dict.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23
- **Strengths**: The persistence mechanism is implemented and tested. All tests for `test_hypergraph_persistence.py` are passing.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Could explore alternative serialization formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers) for efficiency or different storage solutions (e.g., database) for larger hypergraphs.

## Next Steps**:
- Implement Long-Term memory handling.
- Commit the changes.
