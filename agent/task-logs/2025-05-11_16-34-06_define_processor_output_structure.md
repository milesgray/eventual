# Task Log: P2_T2.1 - Define Processor Output Structure

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-05-11
- **Time Started**: 16:30
- **Time Completed**: 16:34
- **Files Modified**:
    - agent/plans/P2_T2.1_Define_Processor_Output_Structure.md
    - agent/memory-index.md
    - agent/core/activeContext.md

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Define standardized data structures for the output of processors, detailing extracted concepts and relationships.
- **Implementation**:
    - Created the plan file `agent/plans/P2_T2.1_Define_Processor_Output_Structure.md`.
    - Documented the proposed structure for processor output, including fields for extracted concepts and events, with examples.
    - Suggested using dataclasses for better type hinting.
    - Updated the `agent/memory-index.md` to include the new plan file.
    - Updated `agent/core/activeContext.md` to reflect the completion of this task and the start of the next.
- **Challenges**: None.
- **Decisions**: Decided to define the structure within the plan file first before implementing corresponding dataclasses in the codebase, to allow for review and refinement of the proposed structure.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23
- **Strengths**: Clearly defined a standardized output structure that meets the requirements for decoupling processors and integrators. Documented the structure effectively.
- **Areas for Improvement**: None for this task.

## Next Steps
- Git commit the changes for Task 2.1.
- Proceed to Task 2.2: Refactor `TextProcessor` Output.
