    - agent/core/activeContext.md

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement the `add_concept_if_not_exists` method in `eventual/core/hypergraph.py` and write unit tests.
- **Implementation**:
    - Confirmed that the `add_concept_if_not_exists` method was already implemented correctly as part of Task 1.1.
    - Added comprehensive unit tests to `tests/test_hypergraph.py` for `add_concept_if_not_exists`, covering scenarios for adding new concepts and handling existing concepts by ID or lemmatized name.
    - Ran `tests/test_hypergraph.py` using pytest in the virtual environment, and all tests passed.
- **Challenges**: None (The method was already implemented).
- **Decisions**: Proceeded directly to writing unit tests upon discovering the method was already present.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23
- **Strengths**: Successfully added comprehensive unit tests for an existing method, confirming its correct behavior under various conditions.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Ensure better cross-task awareness during planning to avoid duplicating implementation tasks (though the existing implementation was correct).

## Next Steps
- Git commit the changes for Task 1.2.
- Proceed to Task 1.3: Refine `add_event` Method.
