# Task Log: P1_T1.3 - Refine add_event Method

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-05-11
- **Time Started**: 10:51
- **Time Completed**: 16:30
- **Files Modified**:
    - eventual/core/hypergraph.py
    - tests/test_hypergraph.py
    - agent/core/activeContext.md

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Review and refine the `add_event` method in `eventual/core/hypergraph.py` to ensure proper linking of concepts and write unit tests.
- **Implementation**:
    - Reviewed the existing `add_event` method implementation.
    - Confirmed that the method correctly retrieves concept *instances* from `self.concepts` using `self.get_concept()`.
    - Confirmed that the event is added to the `events` set of these retrieved `Concept` instances.
    - Confirmed that the event object's `concepts` attribute is updated to reference the stored instances.
    - Added comprehensive unit tests to `tests/test_hypergraph.py` for `add_event`, including tests for single concept, multiple concepts, linking correct instances, handling non-existent concepts, and duplicate event IDs.
    - Modified the `test_add_event_with_multiple_concepts` test to use concepts with distinct lemmas to avoid conflicts with the `add_concept` uniqueness check.
    - Modified the `add_event` method to use `logging.warning` instead of `print` for the non-existent concept message, and updated the corresponding test to use `self.assertLogs`.
    - Ran `tests/test_hypergraph.py` using pytest in the virtual environment, and all 21 tests passed.
- **Challenges**: Encountered test failures in `test_add_event_with_multiple_concepts` and `test_add_event_with_non_existent_concept` due to concept name lemmatization conflicts and incorrect logging usage in the original implementation, respectively. Resolved these by updating the test data and switching to `logging.warning`.
- **Decisions**: Decided to fix the existing `add_event` implementation and add tests rather than a full rewrite, as the core logic for linking concept instances was already largely correct. Switched to standard logging for better testability.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22
- **Strengths**: Successfully identified and fixed issues in the existing code and tests. Added comprehensive test coverage for the `add_event` method, including edge cases.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Pay closer attention to potential interactions between core methods (like `add_concept` uniqueness) when writing tests.

## Next Steps
- Git commit the changes for Task 1.3.
- Begin Phase 2: Decouple Processors from Hypergraph, starting with Task 2.1: Define Processor Output Structure.
