**Key Features:**

- Event-Driven Hypergraphs: Build and manage complex relationships using hypergraphs.
- Chat Message Ingestion: Process raw chat messages.
- Knowledge Retrieval: Query the event hypergraph for relevant information.
- Situational Awareness Adapter: Format retrieved knowledge for LLM context.
- Persistence: Save and load the hypergraph memory.
- Long-Term Memory Handling: Manage recent and older memories.
- Core Concepts: `Concept`, `Event`, `Sensor`, `TemporalBoundary`.
- Data Handling & Streams: Process data flow.
- LLM Integration: Provide structured, contextually relevant representation for LLMs.

**Target User:** Developers building LLM-based agents for conversational environments.
