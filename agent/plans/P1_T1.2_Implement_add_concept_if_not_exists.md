# Plan: P1_T1.2 - Implement add_concept_if_not_exists

## Task Information
- **Phase:** 1 - Strengthen the Core (Hypergraph)
- **Task ID:** 1.2
- **Brief Description:** Create a method `add_concept_if_not_exists(concept: Concept)` in `Hypergraph` that adds a concept only if its ID or name doesn't exist, returning the existing or newly added concept instance from the hypergraph.
- **Files to Modify**:
    - `eventual/core/hypergraph.py`
    - `tests/test_hypergraph.py`

## Goal
To implement the `add_concept_if_not_exists(self, concept: Concept) -> Concept:` method in the `Hypergraph` class. This method should:
1.  Attempt to retrieve the concept by ID using `self.get_concept(concept.concept_id)` (or `self.get_concept_by_id`). If found, return the retrieved concept.
2.  If not found by ID, attempt to retrieve the concept by its lemmatized name using `self.get_concept_by_name(concept.name)`. If found, return the retrieved concept.
3.  If neither is found, call `self.add_concept()` to add the new concept and then return the concept instance that was just added (which is now in `self.concepts`).

## Success Criteria
- The method correctly returns an existing concept if an identical ID is provided.
- The method correctly returns an existing concept if an identical (lemmatized, case-insensitive) name is provided, even if the ID is different (this implies the existing `add_concept` raises an error for duplicate names if IDs are different, which `add_concept_if_not_exists` will avoid by returning the existing one by name).
- The method correctly adds a new concept if no existing concept matches the ID or name.
- The method returns the instance of the concept as it exists *within* the hypergraph.
- Unit tests pass, covering scenarios:
    - Adding a completely new concept.
    - Attempting to add a concept whose ID already exists.
    - Attempting to add a concept whose name (lemmatized, case-insensitive) already exists but ID is different.
    - Attempting to add a concept whose ID and name match an existing concept.
