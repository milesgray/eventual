# Plan: P2_T2.1 - Define Processor Output Structure

## Task Information
- **Phase:** 2 - Decouple Processors from Hypergraph
- **Task ID:** 2.1
- **Brief Description:** Define standardized data structures for the output of processors.
- **Files to Modify**:
    - agent/plans/P2_T2.1_Define_Processor_Output_Structure.md (This file)
    - eventual/processors/__init__.py (Potentially for dataclass definitions)
    - eventual/data/__init__.py (Potentially for data structure definitions)

## Goal
To define clear, standardized Python data structures (e.g., using dataclasses or simple dictionaries) that represent the extracted information from processors like `TextProcessor`. This structure will be the contract between Processors and Integrators.

## Details
The processor output structure should contain enough information to allow an Integrator component to update the `Hypergraph`. Based on the current `Concept` and `Event` structure, the output should likely include:

1.  **Extracted Concepts:** A list of concepts identified in the input data.
    - Each concept entry should minimally include: `id` (a proposed unique identifier), `name`, and potentially `initial_state` or other relevant properties extracted by the processor.
    - Example structure for a concept entry: `{'id': 'concept_xyz', 'name': 'example concept', 'initial_state': 1.0}`

2.  **Extracted Events:** A list of events identified in the input data.
    - Each event entry should minimally include: `id` (a proposed unique identifier), `timestamp` (when the event occurred or was observed), and a list of the `id`s of the concepts involved in the event.
    - It should also include any quantitative data associated with the event, such as a `delta` or a resulting state change.
    - Example structure for an event entry: `{'id': 'event_abc', 'timestamp': '...', 'concept_ids': ['concept_xyz', 'concept_123'], 'delta': 0.5}`

3.  **(Optional but Recommended) Extracted Relationships:** If the processor can identify relationships between concepts that are not explicitly modeled as events, include a structure for these.
    - Example structure for a relationship entry: `{'source_concept_id': 'concept_1', 'target_concept_id': 'concept_2', 'type': 'related_to', 'strength': 0.8}`

The overall output of a processor should be a dictionary or object containing these lists, e.g., `{'concepts': [...], 'events': [...], 'relationships': [...]}`.

Consider defining simple dataclasses in a shared module (like `eventual.data` or `eventual.processors`) for these structures to provide better type hinting and clarity.

## Success Criteria
- A clear data structure format is defined for processor output.
- This format is documented in this plan file.
- The defined structure is capable of representing the information needed by an Integrator to create/update concepts and events in the `Hypergraph`.
- (Optional) Corresponding Python dataclasses or similar structures are defined in the codebase.
