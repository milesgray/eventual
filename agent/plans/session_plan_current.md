# Session Plan

## Goal
Implement testing and evaluation for the chat scenario based on the expanded message handling.

## Steps
1. Review the changes made in the previous task (handling sequence of chat messages).
2. Create a new test file in the `tests/` directory specifically for the chat scenario.
3. Write test cases to simulate a sequence of chat messages and verify the expected behavior of the `eventual/pipeline.py`.
4. Run the new test cases to ensure the implementation is working correctly.
5. Evaluate the current state of the chat scenario implementation against the project goals.
6. Document the test results and evaluation in a new task log.
7. Commit all changes to the repository with a descriptive commit message.
