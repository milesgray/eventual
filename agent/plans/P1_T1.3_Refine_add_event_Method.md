# Plan: P1_T1.3 - Refine add_event Method

## Task Information
- **Phase:** 1 - Strengthen the Core (Hypergraph)
- **Task ID:** 1.3
- **Brief Description:** Ensure the `add_event` method in `Hypergraph` correctly adds an event and links it to the concept *instances* stored within the `Hypergraph`.
- **Files to Modify**:
    - `eventual/core/hypergraph.py`
    - `tests/test_hypergraph.py`

## Goal
To review and refine the `add_event` method in the `Hypergraph` class. This involves:
1.  Verifying that for each concept ID referenced by an incoming `Event` object, the corresponding `Concept` *instance* is retrieved from `self.concepts` using `self.get_concept()` (or `self.get_concept_by_id()`).
2.  Ensuring the event is added to the `events` set of these retrieved `Concept` instances (`stored_concept.events.add(event)`).
3.  Confirming that the event's `concepts` attribute (which is a set of `Concept` objects) correctly references the `Concept` instances stored within the Hypergraph, not potentially different instances passed in with the event. This might involve reconstructing the `event.concepts` set with the hypergraph's own concept instances.
4.  Reviewing and confirming the current warning behavior for events referencing non-existent concepts.

## Success Criteria
- `add_event` correctly adds the event to the `hypergraph.events` dictionary.
- `add_event` correctly updates the `events` attribute of each involved `Concept` *instance* that is stored in `hypergraph.concepts`.
- The `Event` object stored in `hypergraph.events` has its `concepts` attribute populated with `Concept` instances that are from `hypergraph.concepts`.
- Unit tests pass, verifying the correct linking of events to concepts and the integrity of concept references within the added event.
