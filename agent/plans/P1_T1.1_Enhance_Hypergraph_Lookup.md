# Plan: P1_T1.1 - Enhance Hypergraph Lookup

## Task Information
- **Phase:** 1 - Strengthen the Core (Hypergraph)
- **Task ID:** 1.1
- **Brief Description:** Add efficient `get_concept_by_id` and `get_concept_by_name` methods to `eventual/core/hypergraph.py`.
- **Files to Modify**:
    - `eventual/core/hypergraph.py`
    - `tests/test_hypergraph.py`

## Goal
To implement efficient lookup methods in the `Hypergraph` class for retrieving concepts by their ID and by their name. This involves:
1.  Ensuring `self.concepts` is a dictionary mapping concept ID to `Concept` object.
2.  Adding `self._concept_names` as a dictionary mapping a lemmatized, lower-case concept name to concept ID in the `__init__` method.
3.  Modifying the existing `add_concept` method to update both `self.concepts` and `self._concept_names` (using the lemmatized name).
4.  Implementing `get_concept_by_id(concept_id: str) -> Optional[Concept]`.
5.  Implementing `get_concept_by_name(name: str) -> Optional[Concept]`.
6.  Updating internal `Hypergraph` methods (like in `add_event`, `find_related_concepts`, `retrieve_knowledge`, `from_dict`) to use the new lookup methods where appropriate.
7.  Adding unit tests for the new lookup methods.

## Success Criteria
- `get_concept_by_id` returns the correct `Concept` object for a valid ID and `None` otherwise.
- `get_concept_by_name` returns the correct `Concept` object for a valid name (case-insensitive, matching lemma) and `None` otherwise.
- `add_concept` correctly populates both ID-based and name-based lookup structures.
- Internal `Hypergraph` methods are updated to use these new lookups, improving efficiency or clarity.
- Unit tests pass, covering various scenarios (concept exists, does not exist, case variations for name lookup).
- The `_get_lemma` helper method is utilized correctly for name indexing and lookup.
