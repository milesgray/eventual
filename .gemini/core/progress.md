## Roadmap

1.  **Setup Memory Bank:** (DONE) - Establish the `.gemini` directory and core memory files.
2.  **Implement Core Workflow Patterns:** (DONE) Implement the core workflows (Initialization, Documentation, Implementation, Error Recovery, Evaluation, Self-Critique).
3.  **Implement Initial Project Task:** (DONE) Select and implement an initial project task to test the workflow.
4.  **Evaluate and Refine Workflow:** (DONE) Evaluate the performance of the workflow based on the initial task and refine it.
5.  **Implement Structured Decision Optimization:** Implement the structured decision optimization process.
6.  **Expand Project Implementation:** Continue implementing project tasks, using the optimized workflow and decision-making process.

## Chat Scenario Roadmap

1. **Implement Chat Ingestor:** Create a new module or extend an existing one to handle chat messages.
2. **Integrate with Existing Pipelines:** Modify the existing pipelines or create a new one specifically for chat to incorporate the new chat ingestor.
3. **Implement Knowledge Retrieval:** Add a mechanism for agents to retrieve information from the updated event concept graph.
4. **Situational Awareness Adapter:** Create an adapter component that utilizes extracted information from the updated event concept graph, transform the data, and provide the data to an LLM agent.
5.  **Implement Context injection:** Implement the process for injecting these embeddings into the context window of a chatbot LLM.
6.  **Test and Evaluate in Chat Scenario:** Develop test cases specifically for the chat scenario.
7.  **Optimize Performance:** Identify and address any performance bottlenecks in the pipeline.
8.  **Implement Persistence:** Set up the mechanism for making event concept graph data persist.
9.  **Implement Long-Term memory handling:** Given current prompt sizes, and desire to have LLM summarize long-term memories vs. short-term, this functionality should be implemented
