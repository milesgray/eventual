# Task Log: Implement Persistence into Basic Chat Flow

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-05-10
- **Time Started**: 12:45
- **Time Completed**: 14:00
- **Files Modified**:
    - `eventual/pipeline.py`
    - `dummy_pipeline_config.yaml`

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Integrate the persistence mechanism into the basic end-to-end chat processing flow.
- **Implementation**: Modified the `_run_basic_chat_flow` method in `eventual/pipeline.py` to load the hypergraph using `HypergraphPersistence` at the start of the flow and save it at the end. Updated `dummy_pipeline_config.yaml` to include the `hypergraph_save_path` setting.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring the hypergraph instance used throughout the flow is the one loaded from persistence (if it exists).
- **Decisions**: Initialized `HypergraphPersistence` in the `EventualPipeline` constructor and used this instance to load and save the hypergraph within `_run_basic_chat_flow`. Updated `self.hypergraph` with the loaded instance.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23
- **Strengths**: Successfully integrated persistence into the basic chat flow, allowing the hypergraph state to be maintained across pipeline runs.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Error handling for persistence operations could be more robust.

## Next Steps**:
- Implement Long-Term memory handling.
- Commit the changes.
