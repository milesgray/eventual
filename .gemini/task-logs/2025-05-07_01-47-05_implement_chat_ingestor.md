## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement the `ChatIngestor` class for processing chat messages and create corresponding tests.
- **Implementation**:
    - Created `eventual/ingestors/chat_ingestor.py` with the `ChatIngestor` class.
    - The `ChatIngestor` uses a `TextProcessor` instance (either provided or default) to process messages.
    - The `ingest` method takes a chat message string and returns a `ProcessorOutput` object by calling `self._text_processor.extract_concepts(message)`.
    - Created `tests/test_chat_ingestor.py` with initial tests:
        - `test_chat_ingestor_initialization`: Verifies correct initialization with and without a provided `TextProcessor`.
        - `test_chat_ingestor_ingest_basic`: Verifies basic ingestion of a message and checks for expected extracted concepts (TF-IDF based).
- **Challenges**: Correcting a premature termination of file writing that left an invalid syntax in `chat_ingestor.py`.
- **Decisions**: Implemented `ChatIngestor` to use the `TextProcessor.extract_concepts` method for initial functionality, focusing on TF-IDF based concept extraction. LLM-based features can be added later.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23
- **Strengths**: The `ChatIngestor` is implemented with basic functionality and has passing tests. The design allows for future extension (e.g., using different `TextProcessor` methods).
- **Areas for Improvement**: Further tests could be added for edge cases (empty messages, messages with no known concepts) and for LLM-based extraction once that is incorporated.

## Next Steps**:
- Integrate the `ChatIngestor` into existing or new pipelines as per the roadmap.
