# Task Log: Implement Long-Term memory handling

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-05-08
- **Time Started**: 06:42
- **Time Completed**: 09:28
- **Files Modified**:
    - `eventual/adapters/situational_awareness_adapter.py`
    - `tests/test_situational_awareness_adapter.py`

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement long-term memory handling in the Situational Awareness Adapter.
- **Implementation**: Modified the `SituationalAwarenessAdapter.generate_context` method to accept an optional `recent_time_window` parameter. Combined concepts and events from both query-based retrieval and recent events. Adjusted the header for concepts based on whether the query was empty and recent events were included. Updated the tests in `tests/test_situational_awareness_adapter.py` to verify the new functionality and the header logic.
- **Challenges**: Debugging test failures related to the concept header when the query was empty and only recent events were considered. This required careful examination of the `generate_context` logic and the corresponding test assertions.
- **Decisions**: Incorporated the concepts from recent events into `combined_concepts` to ensure they are included in the concepts list when relevant. Refined the header logic to accurately reflect the source of the concepts (query, recent activity, or both).

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23
- **Strengths**: The Situational Awareness Adapter now incorporates long-term memory handling by considering both query relevance and recent activity. All tests for `test_situational_awareness_adapter.py` are passing.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Summarization of long-term memories is a potential future enhancement to manage context window size for LLMs.

## Next Steps**:
- Evaluate and Refine Workflow.
- Commit the changes.
